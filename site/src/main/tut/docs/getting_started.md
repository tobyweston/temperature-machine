# Getting Started

## Setup the Hardware

Connecting the temperature sensor to the Pi is straight forward. There a bunch of [tutorials on the web](https://www.google.co.uk/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=pi+ds18b20+tutorial) but you're looking to connect the following physical pins on the Pi to the following sensor connectors.

Physical Pi Pin | Description | DS18b20 Connector
----------------|-------------|--------
1 | 3.3v Power  | Power (<span style="color:red;">red</span>)
7 | GPIO 4      | Data (<span style="color:orange;">yellow</span>)
9 | Ground      | Ground (<span style="color:black;">black</span>)

The other thing you'll need to do is connect the 4.7k Ω resistor between the power and data lines. This acts as a [pull-up resistor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pull-up-resistors) to ensure that the Pi knows that the data line starts in a "high" state. Without it, it can't tell if it should start as high or low; it would be left _floating_.

Soldering a resistor inline can be a bit tricky, so I build a add-on board to make the whole process simpler. See the [Add-on Board](add-on_board.html) section for details.

## Setup the Pi

Make sure you have the following line in your `/boot/config.txt`. It will load the GPIO [1-wire](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/1_wire) driver and any attached temperature sensor should be automatically detected.

Older tutorials on the web will also say you have to load the `w1-therm` module but that seems to load automatically these days.


## Setup the Software

In terms of installing, you have two options here.

1. Install via `apt-get` (recommended)
1. Build and run from source


## Prerequisites

If you build from source or intend to download and run the the binary, you'll need Java installed on your Pi (`sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk`). The keep up to date you'll need `git` (`sudo apt-get install git`) and if you want to build yourself, you'll need SBT. 

### Install SBT

To setup `sbt` manually, follow these steps from the terminal.

    cd /usr/local/bin
    sudo wget https://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/0.13.16/sbt-launch.jar
    sudo chown pi sbt-launch.jar
    sudo chgrp pi sbt-launch.jar

Create a file `/usr/local/bin/sbt` (change the owner and group as above) and paste the following in (take note that the max memory is set to 512 MB for the Pi Zero). Change the owner and group as above.

    #!/bin/bash
    SBT_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx512M"
    java $SBT_OPTS -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
    
Then make it executable.

    chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/sbt


Or if you prefer the official install, these steps (from [scala-sbt.org](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)).

    echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
    sudo apt-get install dirmngr --install-recommends
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install sbt
