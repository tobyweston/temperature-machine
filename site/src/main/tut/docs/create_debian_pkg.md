[https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager)

Native packager only takes care of packaging, the act of putting a list of mappings (source file to install target path) into a distinct package format (zip, rpm, etc.).

Archetypes like Java Application Archetype or Java Server Application Archetype only add additional files to the mappings enriching the created package, but they donâ€™t provide any new features for native-packager core functionality.

### Not in Scope

* Providing application lifecyle management.
    * The Java Server Application Archetype provides configurations for common systeloaders like SystemV, Upstart or SystemD. However create a custome solution, which includes stop scripts, PID management, etc. are not part of native packager.
* Providing deployment configurations
    * Native packager produces artefacts with the packageBin task. What you do with these is part of another step in your process.

### Core Concepts

1. [Packaging format plugins](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/introduction.html#format-plugins) - the _how_ an application is packaged; universal, linux, debian, rpm, docker, windows etc 
1. [Archetype plugins](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/introduction.html#archetype-plugins) - the _what_ gets packaged (incs.  predefined configurations); java application, java server application, system loaders etc
1. [Mappings](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/introduction.html#mappings) - map source files to target system locations

## Folder Structures

Each packaging format will expect files to include in your package to be in a specific folder. For example, the Universal plugin will look in `src\universal` by default.


## Packaging

### Java

Running `sbt universal:packageBin` would copy anything in `src\universal` into the generated zip file but without adding the Java format plugin, no class files would be included (so the zip would basically be empty).

Include `enablePlugins(JavaApplicationPlugin)` and it will copy in all the JARs (including the application). It also creates default startup scripts which, for us, are no good. They're close; they create an executable (and batch file) for each `App` and a general one to take care of the classpath etc.

So you'll get something like the following.

    total 80
    drwxr-xr-x  9 toby  staff    288  5 Apr 11:15 ./
    drwxr-xr-x  4 toby  staff    128  5 Apr 11:15 ../
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toby  staff   1388  5 Apr 11:15 client*
    -rw-r--r--  1 toby  staff    110  5 Apr 11:15 client.bat
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toby  staff   1388  5 Apr 11:15 server*
    -rw-r--r--  1 toby  staff    110  5 Apr 11:15 server.bat
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toby  staff  11484  5 Apr 11:15 temperature-machine*
    -rw-r--r--  1 toby  staff   7530  5 Apr 11:15 temperature-machine.bat
    
Where `client` for example, ends up running the following.

    # execute the main start script
    $SCRIPTPATH/temperature-machine -main bad.robot.temperature.client.Client "$@"

...and `temperature-machine` handles classpath and Java setup etc.

Including 'enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging)' adds some additional stuff.

### Debian

I think the control file will be defaulted if you don't override it (override by adding into `src\debian\DEBIAN`).

Package with `sbt debian:packageBin`.

When the `.deb` package is built, the same scripts are created in `temperature-machine_2.1-SNAPSHOT_all.deb/data/usr/bin`.

The "log" folder seems to default to `/var/lig/temperature-machine` although I don't know what will go in there.
